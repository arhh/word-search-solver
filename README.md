# word-search-solver
A word search solver written in Python 3.
  
## Requirements to Run:
  * Python 3
  * tkinter
  
  
## Usage:
  * Execute word_search_gui.py
  * Specify number of rows and columns, and the words to find in the "Wordsearch Configuration" window.
  * Click "Generate Grid" to generate an empty grid and close the configuration window.
  * Fill in the empty grid and click "Solve Wordsearch".
  * The location of the **first character** of the matched words will be highlighted in the word search.
  
  
## Flaws:
  * Not very efficient.
  * The "model-view-controller" concept is not fully adhered to in the current implementation.
